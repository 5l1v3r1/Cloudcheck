# Cloudcheck

Cloudcheck is made to be used in the same folder as [CloudFail](https://github.com/m0rtem/CloudFail "CloudFail"). Make sure all files in this repo are in the same folder before using.

Cloudcheck will automatically change your hosts file, using entries from CloudFail and test for a specified string to detect if said entry can be used to bypass Cloudflair.
